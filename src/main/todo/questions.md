1. Find the longest palindrome substring in a string

2. Given a stream of characters, find the first character that occurs only once.
```
E.g.[ABCDABDE] -> C
```

3. Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf 
path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
Note: A leaf is a node with no children. 
Example: Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
```
          5
         / \
        4   8  
       /   / \
      11  13  4
     /  \      \
    7    2      1

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
```

4. Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers that add up to a specific target.
Assume there is only one solution, and no duplicates.
```
Given: [2,7,11,9,15], target = 18,
Answer should be [1,2].
```

5. Write class that implement a Binary tree, write the Insertion and Deletion methods

6. Given an N by M matrix consisting only of 1's and 0's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
```
//For example, given the following matrix:

//[[1, 0, 0, 0],
// [1, 0, 1, 1],
// [1, 0, 1, 1],
// [0, 1, 0, 0]]

// Return 4.
```

7. Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.
```
//For example, given [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)],
//You should return 2.
```

8. Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters. If there are multiple possible solutions, return any of them.
```
//For example, given the string "street",
//return "tteesr". "eettsr" would also be acceptable.
```

9. Assume you tree, binary tree. And you will be given an array of values that we need to delete from the Tree. return the tree after deleting the values.
