  * Phone keys have mnemonics assigned to them.

  * '5' -> "JKL",
  * '6' -> "MNO",
  * '7' -> "PQRS",
  * '8' -> "TUV",
  * '9' -> "WXYZ"
  *
  * Assume you are given a dictionary words as a list of words.
  * Design a method translate such that:
  * translate(phoneNumber)
  * produces all phrases of words that can serve as mnemonics
  * for the phone number.
  *
  * Example:
  * The phone number "7225247386" should have the mnemonic
  * 'Scala is fun' as one element of solution phrases.
  *
  * This example was taken from:
  * Lutz Prechelt: An Empirical Comparison of Seven Programming
  * Languages. IEEE Computer 33(10): 23-29 (2000)
  *
  * Tested with Tcl, Python, Perl, Rexx, Java, C++, C.
  *
  * Code size medians:
  * 100 LoC (Line of Code) for scripting languages
  * 200-300 LoC for the others
  *
  * Let's try Scala =)
